1. Overview of failed samples and probe count by beadchip.
2. Raw fluorescence intensities.
3. Methylation beta value distribution.
4. Overview of estimated immune cell composition (ic), age, and smoking CpG methylation (primarily applicable to patient samples).
5. Dimensionality reduction and clustering.
